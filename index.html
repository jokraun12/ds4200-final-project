        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>Supply Chain Management is a discipline that involves determining the best possible methods for sourcing, distributing, and shipping products and services across the globe. 
            It is an extremely important part of a business’ ability to provide its products to clients quickly, efficiently, 
            and all while reducing costs as much as possible. However, we wish to draw connections between these Supply Chain Management 
            successful practices and overall firm financial health. By combining SCM data with firm share price performance as well as 
            market capitalization growth, we are hoping to draw conclusions and insights that teach us about positive (and negative) 
            relationships between certain SCM practices and company-wide financial performance. With the added benefit of our dataset containing 
            information on sustainability ratings for various SCM practices, we hope to add analysis that includes an environmental 
            aspect into some of our conclusions.</p>

        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>Our dataset is composed of data from various companies detailing their Supply Chain Management (SCM) practices, performance metrics, and green logistics initiatives.
            The data contains 1000 observed companies with 29 recorded features. As an extension of our dataset, we will be including firm share price performance as a part of our data processing to get further insight into the relationship between SCM practices and financial performance.
