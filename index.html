        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>Supply Chain Management is a discipline that involves determining the best possible methods for sourcing, distributing, and shipping products and services across the globe. 
            It is an extremely important part of a business’ ability to provide its products to clients quickly, efficiently, 
            and all while reducing costs as much as possible. However, we wish to draw connections between these Supply Chain Management 
            successful practices and overall firm financial health. By combining SCM data with firm share price performance as well as 
            market capitalization growth, we are hoping to draw conclusions and insights that teach us about positive (and negative) 
            relationships between certain SCM practices and company-wide financial performance. With the added benefit of our dataset containing 
            information on sustainability ratings for various SCM practices, we hope to add analysis that includes an environmental 
            aspect into some of our conclusions.</p>

    <section id="data">
        <h2>Data & Sourcing Process</h2>
        <p>Our dataset is composed of data from various companies detailing their Supply Chain Management (SCM) practices, performance metrics, and green logistics initiatives.
            The data contains 1000 observed companies with 29 recorded features. As an extension to these observations, we have incorporated the use of Yahoo Finance's API through
            the <i>yfinance</i> Python package to retrieve financial data on firms in our dataset.  To correctly retrieve the correct data on firms only listed on US stock exchanges,
            we made a series of 1000 GET requests to Yahoo Finance's server to get the listed stock exchange for each firm in our SCM dataset.  <br></br>
            Once this was completed, we were able to slice our dataset to only look at firms listed on US stock exchanges.  After finding the top firms by Operational Efficiency Score
            for each SCM practice, we then downloaded share price data from 2018 to 2024 on those firms.  This is how we sourced the financial data to supplement our original
            dataset.

        <p><strong><i>Figure 3. </i></strong> The above visualization breaks out each SCM Practice to show the relationship between the average 
          Customer Satisfaction Rating and the Inventory Turnover Ratio for each respective practice.  The <i>inventory turnover ratio</i> can be 
          described as the rate that inventory stock is sold, or used, and replaced.  <br></br>

          <strong>Note: </strong><i>Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory</i>; generally, a higher ratio indicates more efficient
          SCM processes.

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <h3>I. Comparing SCM Practices by Operational Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
          The box plot shows a clear visual comparison of how operational efficiency scores vary across different SCM practices. 
          Most practices have a median efficiency score of 85, with fairly consistent interquartile ranges which suggests a general industry standard around this value. <br><br>

          Agile SCM displays the widest spread of data that ranges from a minimum of 75 to a maximum of 90, and includes a slightly lower Q1. This tells us that there is broader range of operational efficiency outcomes for companies that adopt Agile SCM, indicating that the success of this approach may depend heavily on how effectively it’s implemented.
          Cross-Docking contrastingly shows one of the tightest distributions that ranges only from 80 to 85 which indicates consistent operational outcomes across companies that implement it. <br><br>

          Interestingly, Just-In-Time and Lean Manufacturing have the same upper quartile and median of 85 but Just-In-Time does have a slightly narrower range between its lowest and highest values. This indicates that companies using this SCM often achieve more similar and predictable efficiency outcomes.
          Sustainable SCM stands out with an outlier on the lower end at 75, suggesting that even though the median is competitive there may be firms struggling to efficiently integrate sustainability into their supply chain operations.

          In terms of highest average inventory turnover ratio, the <strong>Efficient Consumer Response</strong> strategy boasts a ratio of 10.025, alongside
          a customer satisfaction rating of 88.75%.  

          Further, the <strong>Cross-Docking </strong>strategy boasts the highest average customer satisfaction rating, that being 90.33%, alongside an
          inventory turnover ratio of 9.21.

        <h3>IV. Relationship bewteen SCM Practice & Financial Performance</h3>
        <p>
          Evaluating financial data of top performing firms on any level is a difficult way to find differentiation, as most of them (outside of individual
          firm volatility) follow the overall market trends.  However, with the unfortunate occurrence of COVID-19, we experienced a large recessionary
          downturn in the market in March of 2022.  This can be indicated by the dashed vertical lines present on the axis of the two aforementioned visualizations.

        <h3>III. Comparing SCM Practices by Key Metrics</h3>
        <p>
          We can clearly see that there is a trend between higher <i>inventory turnover ratio</i> and a higher <i>customer satisfaction rating,</i> with the
          exception of one outlier in the plotted data-points: <strong>Cross-Docking.</strong> <br></br>
          
          From a logical standpoint, this makes sense.  Inventory turnover ratio being higher generally means good things about SCM practices
          and overall efficiency levels, but it is not the only metric.  It is important to note that <i>too</i> high of an inventory turnover ratio
          can indicate a risk that the firm may not have enough stock on hand at some given times to meet consumer demand.  Given the lower customer
          satisfaction rating for such a high inventory turnover ratio, we can draw the conclusion that <strong>Cross-Docking</strong> may be a practice
          that prioritizes inventory turnover over meeting the needs of the consumer, or rather the needs of the firm's distribution systems.
