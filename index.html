        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>Supply Chain Management is a discipline that involves determining the best possible methods for sourcing, distributing, and shipping products and services across the globe. 
            It is an extremely important part of a business’ ability to provide its products to clients quickly, efficiently, 
            and all while reducing costs as much as possible. However, we wish to draw connections between these Supply Chain Management 
            successful practices and overall firm financial health. By combining SCM data with firm share price performance as well as 
            market capitalization growth, we are hoping to draw conclusions and insights that teach us about positive (and negative) 
            relationships between certain SCM practices and company-wide financial performance. With the added benefit of our dataset containing 
            information on sustainability ratings for various SCM practices, we hope to add analysis that includes an environmental 
            aspect into some of our conclusions.</p>
      </section>

    <section id="data">
        <h2>Data & Sourcing Process</h2>
        <p>Our dataset is composed of data from various companies detailing their Supply Chain Management (SCM) practices, performance metrics, and green logistics initiatives.
            The data contains 1000 observed companies with 29 recorded features. As an extension to these observations, we have incorporated the use of Yahoo Finance's API through
            the <i>yfinance</i> Python package to retrieve financial data on firms in our dataset.  To correctly retrieve the correct data on firms only listed on US stock exchanges,
            we made a series of 1000 GET requests to Yahoo Finance's server to get the listed stock exchange for each firm in our SCM dataset.  <br></br>
            Once this was completed, we were able to slice our dataset to only look at firms listed on US stock exchanges.  After finding the top firms by Operational Efficiency Score
            for each SCM practice, we then downloaded share price data from 2018 to 2024 on those firms.  This is how we sourced the financial data to supplement our original
            dataset.

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <h3>I. Comparing SCM Practices by Operational Efficiency</h3>
        <p>
          The box plot shows a clear visual comparison of how operational efficiency scores vary across different SCM practices. 
          Most practices have a median efficiency score of 85, with fairly consistent interquartile ranges which suggests a general standard around this value. <br><br>

          Agile SCM displays the widest spread of data that ranges from a minimum of 75 to a maximum of 90, and includes a slightly lower Q1. This tells us that there is broader range of operational efficiency outcomes for companies that adopt Agile SCM, indicating that the success of this approach may depend heavily on how effectively it’s implemented.
          Cross-Docking contrastingly shows one of the tightest distributions that ranges only from 80 to 85 which indicates consistent operational outcomes across companies that implement it. <br><br>

          Interestingly, Just-In-Time and Lean Manufacturing have the same upper quartile and median of 85 but Just-In-Time does have a slightly narrower range between its lowest and highest values. This indicates that companies using this SCM often achieve more similar and predictable efficiency outcomes.
          Sustainable SCM stands out with an outlier on the lower end at 75, suggesting that even though the median is competitive there may be firms struggling to efficiently integrate sustainability into their supply chain operations. 

          All of the SCM practices achieve maximum efficiency scores of approximately 90 (with Just-In-Time and Demand-Driven SCM showing individual high outliers), demonstrating that high efficiency is possible regardless of the SCM strategy chosen.
        </p>
        <h3>II. Market Leaders and Their Supply Chain Strategies </h3>
        <p>
          This chart highlights the dominance of certain supply chain approaches among large corporations. The SCM practices are categorized using different colors, 
          as detailed in the legend. The most prominent SCM strategies appear to be <strong>Agile SCM</strong> (green) and <strong>Lean Manufacturing</strong> (purple), 
          which are utilized by major corporations such as Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft. Less common practices, such as Vendor Managed Inventory (red) and 
          Efficient Consumer Response (brown), are represented by fewer companies. This suggests that certain SCM strategies are more widely adopted by industry leaders, 
          potentially due to their scalability and efficiency in handling global supply chains.  
          <br></br>
          Companies using Agile SCM (Apple, Amazon, Tesla) prioritize rapid response to demand changes, customization, and flexibility in their supply chains. 
          This more flexible strategy is particularly suited for industries where innovation cycles are fast and consumer demand fluctuates. 
          Lean Manufacturing (Nvidia, Microsoft, Facebook) focuses on minimizing waste, reducing inefficiencies, and create value for customers to enhance cost efficient 
          and maintain a steady output. It is valuable for industries where demand is relatively predictable and manufacturing processes can be streamlined. 
          <br></br>
          One notable callout is <strong>Google</strong>, which employs the <strong>Cross-Docking SCM</strong> strategy and has a simnifically larger number of supplies—approximately <strong>20,000</strong>. 
          This extensive supplier network is a key differentiator, allowing Google to maintain a flexible and responsive supply chain. Cross-docking minimizes 
          storage time by directly transferring incoming shipments to outbound transportation, reducing warehousing costs and improving efficiency. 
          Google’s reliance on this approach likely plays a role in managing its large supplier base to ensure smooth operations. 
        </p>
        <h3>III. Comparing SCM Practices by Key Metrics</h3>
        <p>
          In terms of highest average inventory turnover ratio, the <strong>Efficient Consumer Response</strong> strategy boasts a ratio of 10.025, alongside
          a customer satisfaction rating of 88.75%.  

          Further, the <strong>Cross-Docking </strong>strategy boasts the highest average customer satisfaction rating, that being 90.33%, alongside an
          inventory turnover ratio of 9.21.
          <br></br>

          We can clearly see that there is a trend between higher <i>inventory turnover ratio</i> and a higher <i>customer satisfaction rating,</i> with the
          exception of one outlier in the plotted data-points: <strong>Cross-Docking.</strong> <br></br>
          
          From a logical standpoint, this makes sense.  Inventory turnover ratio being higher generally means good things about SCM practices
          and overall efficiency levels, but it is not the only metric.  It is important to note that <i>too</i> high of an inventory turnover ratio
          can indicate a risk that the firm may not have enough stock on hand at some given times to meet consumer demand.  Given the lower customer
          satisfaction rating for such a high inventory turnover ratio, we can draw the conclusion that <strong>Cross-Docking</strong> may be a practice
          that prioritizes inventory turnover over meeting the needs of the consumer, or rather the needs of the firm's distribution systems.
          <br></br>
        </p>
        <h3>IV. Relationship bewteen SCM Practice & Financial Performance</h3>
        <p>
          Evaluating financial data of top performing firms on any level is a difficult way to find differentiation, as most of them (outside of individual
          firm volatility) follow the overall market trends.  However, with the unfortunate occurrence of COVID-19, we experienced a large recessionary
          downturn in the market in March of 2020.  This can be indicated by the dashed vertical lines present on the axis of the two aforementioned visualizations.
          <br></br>
          While COVID-19 impacted the world economy on a global stage and in various different aspects, the Global Supply Chain System was uprooted from the ground.
          Due to this, firms around the globe that lacked the proper SCM strategies and infrastructure were hit particularly badly by the pandemic's recession.  To this
          effect, we decided to look at the share price performance of various firms at the top of their respective SCM practice as exemplars of how certain strategies
          held up to the COVID-era recessionary downturn.
          <br></br>
          As stated in the caption, the <strong><i>SPY</i></strong> ticker indicates the performance of State Street's S&P500 ETF, which we are using as a benchmark to 
          track the overall movements of the US stock market during this time.  As we can see, all of the firms we had chosen follow the same share price underperformance
          during this time period as the market, which is to be expected.  However, the important part to note here is the intensity of the underperformance as well as the 
          length of recovery time.  This is what we used as our indicator for differentiating between the performance during COVID of specific SCM practices.
          <br></br>
          For reference, from our start date of January 1st, 2018 to February 20, 2020, the S&P500 had realized a cumulative return of <i>30.17%</i>.  By March 23, 2020, the S&P500
          realized a cumulative return of <i>-13.37%</i>.  The market did not return to it's previous high until <strong>August 5th, 2020</strong>.  We will be making our analysis based strictly on 
          this time period.

                <li>It is important to note that the world began to experience a chip shortage after COVID, putting Intel, Nvidia, and AMD on the map 
                    as some of the most important firms around. Due to the volatility amongst chip producers in the world at the time, it is too
                    ambiguous to blame poor stock performance solely on Intel's SCM practices, or any one event for that matter.

                  during COVID.  However the Agile SCM practice is one that encourages lean design and thinking, constantly adapting to change and new adverse conditions
                  in the market, which would most definitely bode well for a firm attempting to recover during the pandemic.

      <h2>Summary of Key Findings</h2>
        <p>
          Our project examines the impact and efficiency of various Supply Chain Management practices across operational, 
          strategic, and financial metrics.  Utilizing an Operational Efficiency Score as a KPI, we found that most SCM practices exhibit a 
          median score around 85, though Agile SCM shows more variability among its datapoints.  Similarly to the Agile Development process in 
          Software Engineering, Agile SCM prides itself on being a fluid process to ensure that the strategy can smoothly adapt to changes 
          in the macro and microenvironments – with this line of reasoning as well as the data we uncovered through our analysis, this 
          suggests that the implementation of this SCM practice plays a crucial role in the final outcome.  
          <br></br>
          Large firms and market leaders like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon predominantly adopt Agile and Lean SCM practices, likely 
          due to their adaptability and scalability.  From a financial standpoint, firms that have adopted Agile SCM as a distribution 
          strategy saw quicker recoveries post-COVID, while Sustainable SCM showed less resilience; it is important to note here that 
          financial performance can be attributed to swathes of different external factors, and we can only draw speculative conclusions without 
          forming a mathematically accurate factor model for share price analysis.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Key Points:</h3>
      
        <h4>Operational Efficiency:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Most SCM practices in our dataset adopt a median operational efficiency score of 85.</li>
          <li><strong>Agile SCM</strong> shows the widest spread, indicating outcome variability based on execution.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Docking SCM</strong> demonstrates a dense distribution, indicating consistency amongst efficiency scores</li>
          <li><strong>Sustainable SCM</strong> features a notable low outlier, hinting at implementation challenges.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>Adoption by Market Leaders:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Agile SCM</strong> (Apple, Amazon, Tesla) is tailored to firms requiring scalability and rapid response.</li>
          <li><strong>Lean Manufacturing SCM</strong> (Microsoft, Nvidia, Facebook) aligns with efficiency and waste reduction.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Docking SCM</strong>, used by Google, supports their massive supplier base (20,000).</li>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>Performance by Key Metrics:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cross-Docking</strong> has the highest average customer satisfaction rating at 90.33% accompanied by the second highest inventory turnover ratio of 9.22.</li>
          <li><strong>Efficient Consumer Response</strong> has the highest inventory turnover ratio at 10.025, but a slightly lower customer satisfaction rating of 88.75%.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Higher turnover generally correlates with higher satisfaction—though this SCM practice shows this is an exception.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      
        <h4>Financial Resilience During COVID:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Abbott Laboratories (Agile SCM)</strong> rebounded quickly after the COVID market downturn, and consistently outperformed the market.</li>
          <li><strong>Google (Cross-Docking)</strong> recovered steadily and beat pre-COVID levels by mid-2022, as opposed to the market which didn’t fully recover until August 5th, 2020.</li>
          <li><strong>Intel (Sustainable SCM)</strong> did not fully recover by the end of 2020; however performance was impacted by external factors like the chip shortage and new strong competitors in the industry.</li>
          <li>From a logical standpoint, as well as from our information presented by our visualizations, <strong>Agile SCM</strong> appears to be the best distribution and SCM strategy to handle macro-economic downturns, as 
            well as being the most adaptable to novel adverse conditions.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="future">
      <h2>Future Implications</h2>
          <ol>
            <li> The increasing frequency of global disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has exposed vulnerabilities in supply chains. 
              Companies must adopt more flexible, adaptive strategies to mitigate future crises effectively. 
            </li>
            <li> Artificial intelligence will play a critical role in enhancing supply chain efficiency. AI-powered analytics can help companies anticipate disruptions, 
              optimize resource allocation, and improve decision making in real-time.
