        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>Supply Chain Management is a discipline that involves determining the best possible methods for sourcing, distributing, and shipping products and services across the globe. 
            It is an extremely important part of a business’ ability to provide its products to clients quickly, efficiently, 
            and all while reducing costs as much as possible. However, we wish to draw connections between these Supply Chain Management 
            successful practices and overall firm financial health. By combining SCM data with firm share price performance as well as 
            market capitalization growth, we are hoping to draw conclusions and insights that teach us about positive (and negative) 
            relationships between certain SCM practices and company-wide financial performance. With the added benefit of our dataset containing 
            information on sustainability ratings for various SCM practices, we hope to add analysis that includes an environmental 
            aspect into some of our conclusions.</p>

    <section id="data">
        <h2>Data & Sourcing Process</h2>
        <p>Our dataset is composed of data from various companies detailing their Supply Chain Management (SCM) practices, performance metrics, and green logistics initiatives.
            The data contains 1000 observed companies with 29 recorded features. As an extension to these observations, we have incorporated the use of Yahoo Finance's API through
            the <i>yfinance</i> Python package to retrieve financial data on firms in our dataset.  To correctly retrieve the correct data on firms only listed on US stock exchanges,
            we made a series of 1000 GET requests to Yahoo Finance's server to get the listed stock exchange for each firm in our SCM dataset.  <br></br>
            Once this was completed, we were able to slice our dataset to only look at firms listed on US stock exchanges.  After finding the top firms by Operational Efficiency Score
            for each SCM practice, we then downloaded share price data from 2018 to 2024 on those firms.  This is how we sourced the financial data to supplement our original
            dataset.

      <h2>Visualizations</h2>
        <h3>I. Box Plot: Operational Efficiency by SCM Practice</h3>
        <iframe src="scm_boxplot.html" width="1000" height="700" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <h3>II. Market Leaders and Their Supply Chain Strategies</h3>
        <iframe src="bubblechart.html" width="1200" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <p><strong><i>Figure 2. </i></strong> The buble chart above visualizes the top 20 U.S. companies by market capitilization, highlighting their respective SCM practices.
          Each bubble represents a company, with the size of the bubble indicating its market cap and color indicating the SCM practice it employs.
        </p>
        <h3>III. Comparing SCM Practices by Key Metrics</h3>
        <iframe src="scatterplot_fig.html" width="1000" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <p><strong><i>Figure 3. </i></strong> The above visualization breaks out each SCM Practice to show the relationship between the average 
          Customer Satisfaction Rating and the Inventory Turnover Ratio for each respective practice.  The <i>inventory turnover ratio</i> can be 
          described as the rate that inventory stock is sold, or used, and replaced.  <br></br>

          In terms of highest average inventory turnover ratio, the <strong>Efficient Consumer Response</strong> strategy boasts a ratio of 10.025, alongside
          a customer satisfaction rating of 88.75%.  

          Further, the <strong>Cross-Docking </strong>strategy boasts the highest average customer satisfaction rating, that being 90.33%, alongside an
          inventory turnover ratio of 9.21.
          <br></br>

          <strong>Note: </strong><i>Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory</i>; generally, a higher ratio indicates more efficient
          SCM processes.

        <p><strong><i>Figure 4.1 </i></strong> The above figure displays the share price of 7 companies over time.  Each of these companies has been identified
          as the top firm by Operational Efficiency Score for their respective SCM practice.

        <iframe src="cum_rtns_plot.html" width="1000" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
        <p><strong><i>Figure 4.2 </i></strong> The above figure displays the cumulative return on the stock of of 7 companies over time.  Each of these companies has been identified
          as the top firm by Operational Efficiency Score for their respective SCM practice.
